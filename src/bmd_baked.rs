//! Baked BMD draw states for the inspected 1.4.2 client.
//!
//! World BMDs are *baked*: the client lights them into two per-vertex colours
//! (mesh members `+0x284`/`+0x288`) and blends those two arrays at `0x7b9bc0`
//! with the world day/night weight. They never enter the ordinary receiving
//! path (`0x7a714f..0x7a7158`, `0x7926d2..0x79275a`), which would add regional
//! ambient/diffuse/specular a second time.
//!
//! The submitter is `0x7a9730` for the ordinary world draw (`0x7a9120` is the
//! refraction variant, which differs only in the stage-0 alpha argument) and
//! its per-mesh loop is `0x7a9808..0x7a99bc`. Every row of [`DrawState`] is a
//! write in that loop:
//!
//! | state | write site | value for baked meshes |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `LIGHTING` (`0x77a3c0`, id 0x89) | `0x7a9759` | 0, so material colours never contribute |
//! | `SPECULARENABLE` (`0x77b570`, id 0x1d) | `0x7a9762` | 0 |
//! | stage 0 `COLOROP` (`0x779fc0`) | `0x7a976d` | 5 `MODULATE2X`, args `TEXTURE`, `DIFFUSE` (`0x7a977a`) |
//! | stage 0 `ALPHAOP` (`0x77a020`) | `0x7a9785` | 4 `SELECTARG2`, args `TEXTURE`, `DIFFUSE` (`0x7a9792`) |
//! | stages 1..7 | `0x7a979e`/`0x7a97aa` | disabled (`COLOROP`/`ALPHAOP` = 1) |
//! | `CULLMODE` (`0x77a540`, id 0x16) | `0x7a98cf`, restored `0x7a9a26`/`0x7a9a49` | 1 `NONE` when `mesh+0x26c` is set, else the pass default (2 `CCW`) |
//! | `ALPHATEST` (`0x77a320`, id 0xf) | `0x7a992b` / `0x7a98f8` | 0, unless `mesh+0x2cc` differs from `0xff` |
//!
//! `mesh+0x2cc` is initialised to `0xff` by the mesh constructor (`0x7b9408`,
//! `movl $0xff,0x2cc(%esi)`) and no BMD reader writes it, so in 1.4.2 the alpha
//! test stays disabled for every file-authored mesh; the enabled branch
//! (`0x7a98f8..0x7a9924`) computes `80 * alpha / 255 + 1` as `ALPHAREF`.
//! No write of `ALPHABLENDENABLE` exists in the baked path either: the queue
//! outside the mesh loop owns transparency, so a baked mesh is opaque here.
//!
//! Depth: the world pass leaves `ZFUNC` at the D3D8 default (`LESSEQUAL`) and
//! never writes `ZBIAS` (`0x77a250` is called only from the effect path at
//! `0x417453`, value 2, restored at `0x417471`). Under the viewer's reversed
//! projection that stays `GREATER` for the terrain and becomes `GREATER_EQUAL`
//! for baked scenery, so a coincident duplicate submitted later wins exactly
//! as it does in the client's single depth buffer.
