//! Populator add-on: spawns the real world population the way the game does.
//!
//! Scope, in the client's own terms: the shipped `element/data/task_npc.data`
//! places 1,572 quest NPCs, each one resolved to its `NPC_ESSENCE` template and
//! drawn with that template's `.ecm` rig out of `models.pck`. Mobs have no
//! client-side placement file (the server owns `gamedata/npcgen.data`), so the
//! module loads the 4,208 real `MONSTER_ESSENCE` templates and draws no mob
//! until a placement source is supplied. Native actors move only along real
//! navigation paths from server data. An explicitly enabled Live World
//! (Experimental) prototype tries synthetic city residents using original
//! human rigs, validated retargeted locomotion clips and safe local routes.
//!
//! Everything here is module-owned: archives, rig cache, texture cache, GPU
//! draws, simulation and settings. The host supplies a camera position (which
//! populates the streamed set) and one render hook.
