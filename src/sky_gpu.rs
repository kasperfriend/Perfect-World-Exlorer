//! Native day/night sky dome: recovered geometry, projection and sky clock.
//!
//! The mesh tables, the texture-set switch and the celestial billboards all come
//! from `elementclient.exe` and are unit tested in [`crate::sky_geometry`],
//! [`crate::sky_time`] and [`crate::sky_celestial`]; this module only uploads
//! them. The recovered parts are the mesh rows and their texture runs, the
//! planar cap disc, the sun/moon billboards and the sky clock.
//! The band the two native buffers leave open (38.16-72.5 degrees) is filled by
//! continuing the cap's own recovered planar lookup over the whole upper
//! hemisphere. That is the one fill that cannot produce an artifact: it is the
//! surface the cap already draws, evaluated outside the 17.5 degree cap disc,
//! and `clear\roof.bmp` is authored to tile (opposite borders differ by less
//! than one pixel step), so the repeat sampler carries it past one tile exactly
//! where the client's wrap addressing would. Retail draws *something* there
//! with the same texture (`[A3DSky+0x54]`, `0x799f88`, vtable `+0x1c`) and that
//! object is still unidentified; using the cap's projection for it is a
//! viewer-only composition and is labelled as such in the settings status.
//!
//! The ceiling is drawn through the client's own stage-0 texture matrix.
//! `A3DSky::Tick` (`0x79a040`) rebuilds it every frame from the seven-float
//! descriptor at `+0x4cc` (`A3DSky::Rotate`, `0x79a0e0`), `CECWorld::LoadSky`
//! (`0x42a98d`) puts 0.003 in both rate slots, the constructor `0x7995e0` puts
//! 8.0 on the diagonal and leaves the angle at zero, and `A3DSky::Render`
//! (`0x799a40`) enables the transform for stage 0 (`0x77a1f0(0, 2)`) and hangs
//! the matrix there with `A3DDevice::SetTextureMatrix` (`0x779da0`). The ceiling
//! is therefore sampled at `8 * uv + drift` with repeat addressing, and the
//! drift is a slide of 0.003 texture units per second with no rotation. The
//! curtain inherits the stage-1 matrix, which stays identity, so its panorama
//! keeps the authored UVs.
//!
//! The curtain keeps its authored rim fade (`alpha` 0 at 39.27, 1 at 19.64) and
//! is composited *over* the roof sheet, so the skirt fades into the sky instead
//! of into the pass clear colour. Earlier fills faded the band into that
//! background, which is what drew a dark ring under the panorama rim.
//!
//! The day/night change is the client's own `sky.lst` swap: `autoscene.cfg`
//! names `sky_id_day = 0` (clear) and `sky_id_night = 1` (overcast), and the
//! regional light record darkens the selected set through dusk and night. The
//! three `sky.lst` rows are loaded in file order; the third (sunset) is
//! available to a region that names it. The two texture runs the island split
//! switches between crossfade over 3.4 degrees instead of meeting at a hard
//! seam.

//
// Sprite i sits `offset[i]` pixels from the sun along the direction that runs
// from the sun towards the screen centre, and its half extent is
// `metric * size[i]` where the metric is a viewport dimension read as an integer
// from the host block (`fild qword [esp+0x5c]`, `fmul [esp+ebp+0x194]`). Which
// of that block's six dwords is the metric is the one value still unpinned - it
// is the fifth (`[esp+0x290]`) - so the viewer takes the viewport height, the
