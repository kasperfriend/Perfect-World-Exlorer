//! AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution — the real integration (Windows + DX12).
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! The engine half of the "Upscaling" setting in Graphics. When FSR is the
//! active provider (`settings.upscaling == Fsr` and the hardware/SDK gates in
//! `crate::support` pass), the world is rendered at the FSR-recommended
//! internal resolution, a temporal motion vector is reconstructed from the
//! depth buffer by a fullscreen pass, and the AMD FidelityFX SDK FSR upscaler
//! is dispatched on its own native D3D12 command list to produce the
//! full-resolution image. The result is composited into the usual composition
//! view, so UI, minimap, gamma ramp and present-encode are unchanged.
//!
//! * The loader (`amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll`) is loaded with
//!   LoadLibraryW/GetProcAddress from the same SDK directory the probe scanned
//!   (Settings → `upscale_sdk_dir`, `PW_UPSCALER_SDK_DIR`, or `<exe>\sdk\`).
//!   The provider version is queried with `ffxQueryDescGetVersions` and the
//!   newest FSR provider is requested with `ffxOverrideVersion`; the provider
//!   actually selected is logged to stderr. The provider version is never
//!   hardcoded.
//! * The dispatch descriptor matches `ffxDispatchDescUpscale` in
//!   sdk/include/upscalers/ffx_upscale.h (FidelityFX SDK 2.4.0).
//! * Color is perceptual sRGB and depth is reversed (near→1, far→0), so the
//!   context is created with `FFX_UPSCALE_ENABLE_DEPTH_INVERTED` and
//!   `FFX_UPSCALE_ENABLE_NON_LINEAR_COLORSPACE`, and the dispatch carries
//!   `FFX_UPSCALE_FLAG_NON_LINEAR_COLOR_SRGB`. No exposure texture is passed;
//!   `preExposure` is 1.0.
//! * The camera is jittered with the FFX jitter sequence
//!   (ffxQueryDescUpscaleGetJitterPhaseCount / GetJitterOffset). The world
//!   pass is the only jittered view; the MV pass and the UI/minimap overlays
//!   use unjittered matrices.
//! * Motion vectors are reconstructed from depth only, so they describe
//!   *camera* motion; actors that move in world space are reprojected as if
//!   they had not moved. There is no per-object velocity pass
//!   (see docs/blockers.md B-5).
//! * wgpu and the native FFX work synchronise through queue ordering on the
//!   single D3D12 direct queue wgpu-hal creates: wgpu submits, then the FFX
//!   command list executes, then wgpu composites. Barriers inside the FFX
//!   list move every input/output into the state FFX expects and back to the
//!   state wgpu's tracker believes in, so no trackers desynchronise.
//!
//! ## What is not verified
//!
//! No machine this code is developed on has a GPU, and the CI runners do not
//! either. Everything past "does it compile on Windows" is runtime-unverified:
//! the jitter sign convention, the motion-vector direction and even basic
//! operation. If FFX context creation or the dispatch fails, the viewer logs
//! the error and falls back to the bilinear path for the rest of the session
//! instead of crashing. DLSS and XeSS are not integrated; neither is frame
//! generation (the wgpu swapchain is owned by wgpu-hal 0.19 and FSR Frame
//! Generation needs to create/wrap the swapchain itself).
//!
//! ## Non-Windows
//!
//! The whole module is a stub off Windows: `FsrUpscaler::new` always fails
//! with "not supported on this platform", so Linux builds stay green and the
//! Windows build is the compile authority.
