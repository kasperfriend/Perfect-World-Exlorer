# Phase 1 — Agent 1 report: scene-light ownership, receiving classes, production submission

Branch: `arena/bdae8dca-perfect-world-exlorer`, based on reviewed state `3b4cc59`
(latest merged revision here: `9aea524`). Date: 2026-11-02.
Target: the supplied Perfect World 1.4.2 executable and assets.

## 0. Environment and what was actually executed

The development sandbox contains **only the Git checkout**: no supplied 1.4.2
client binary, no `element/` asset tree, no `models.pck`/`gfx.pck`/`world.ecwld`,
and **no Rust toolchain** (no `cargo`/`rustc`, and the toolchain download hosts are
not reachable, so none can be installed). Two consequences, stated up front:

- No new native address could be traced in this session. Every native claim below
  is an existing trace in `Findings/Research-log-02-rendering-and-lighting.md`;
  where that evidence ends the work is recorded as a gap, not a guess.
- All compilation and test execution therefore happened in GitHub Actions on this
  branch (`arena/bdae8dca-perfect-world-exlorer`, PR #3). A temporary workflow
  (`ci-diag.yml`, since removed) ran the same steps as `pr-checks.yml` plus the
  standalone module tests, applied `rustfmt`, and published the captured output
  so it could be read through the API. It found three real defects that a review
  pass had missed (see section 11). Everything below marked "executed" is from
  those runs, not from local execution.

Latest fully verified run: workflow **PR checks and Windows build**, run
`41488072928` on commit `9b7996e0a20255d1be8588157a19f367816dacbf` — **success**,
every step in both jobs:
`Check formatting`, `Verify recovered regional arithmetic on x87`,
`Test requirement status audits`, `Check all binary targets`,
`Test GFX light dependency audit`, `Run viewer unit tests`,
`Run Phase 1 production shader regressions` (all 13 GPU binaries), and on Windows
`Compare production gamma with independent x86 MSVCRT words`,
`Verify native gamma and glow CPU references on Windows` and
`Build standalone viewer`. The earlier run `41487134319` on `1be0c72` was the first
green one. The temporary diagnostics workflow has been deleted from the branch.

## 1. Task 1 — light producers and owner lifecycles

### 1.1 What now exists

New module `src/gfx_owner.rs` — a real owner graph for light-producing effects,
not a publication API waiting for a caller:

- `Request` is one owned GFX root: stable `identity`, normalized root path,
  column-major placement `transform`, authored `speed`, `priority`, owner
  `start_ms`/`span_ms`, optional `outer` colour, `active` (region + time of day)
  and a diagnostic `origin`.
- `placement_transform()` reproduces the ECWLD placement construction: normalize
  forward and up **separately**, cross product for right, normalize, then apply
  the authored scale, translation last. Degenerate/parallel axes and non-finite
  inputs are errors.
- `Manager` owns the lifecycle: `insert` (validated, duplicate identity
  rejected), `set_active`/`active` (region/time visibility, never progression),
  `remove` (destroys **and** unregisters), `clear` (region unload),
  `update` (tick then lazy-load), `status`/`failures`/`origins`.
- Per-update order matches native `0x5b1a00`: live owners tick and publish first,
  then **at most one** pending root is loaded and the update returns. A load
  frame publishes nothing for the newly loaded root; already-live owners keep
  publishing.
- Owner clock: `elapsed += trunc(delta * speed)`; `span_ms` destruction at
  `elapsed >= start + span`; `visible = active && elapsed >= start`. Visibility
  and priority gate **publication only** — keypoint time always advances
  (`0x70ba00`).
- Publication identity is `(owner_serial << 32) | element_index`, so two owners
  can never collide and destruction removes exactly the elements that owner
  published. Root loading failures, unsupported container formats, missing
  readers and clock overflow are recorded as named failures; a failed root never
  blocks later owners and is not retried as a substitute.

### 1.2 Production call sites (not a diagnostic path)

- `src/world_models_gpu.rs::World::attach_gfx_archive(element)` — opens
  `element/gfx.pck` with the production `pck` reader, GBK-decodes text roots and
  refuses binary containers explicitly.
- `World::install_scene_effects(&scene::Scene)` — installs one owner per actual
  `ECWLD` `Effect` record (`placement_transform`, authored speed, `valid_time`
  eligibility, origin `world.ecwld (row,col) export N`).
- `World::install_model_events()` — installs ECM `EventType 100` roots that carry
  no `HookName` at the instance placement transform; a non-empty hook is reported
  as an unimplemented attachment instead of being attached to the model origin.
- `World::set_view_center(x, z, radius)` — the region gate used for load/unload.
- `World::update_pass(...)` (main pass, `advance == true`):
  1. `apply_activation(night)` → `scene::effect_visible(mode, night)` **and** the
     view radius,
  2. `owners.update(delta, &mut publications)` — real producer tick,
  3. `grid.update(lights, center)`,
  4. `publications.consume_into(&mut grid)`.
  Producers therefore publish before the consumption step, so a light created on
  this tick already lights this frame's receivers.
- `src/gpu.rs::Renderer::new` calls `attach_gfx_archive` + `install_scene_effects`
  + `install_model_events`, logs the installed counts and every producer failure.
- `src/gpu.rs::Renderer::draw_models` calls `set_view_center` with
  `detail.radius × scene.block_size` before `update_pass`.
- `src/main.rs` now retains `scene::Scene` on `Terrain`
  (`scene: Arc<scene::Scene>`) so the renderer owns the real ECWLD records. This
  is the only reason the effect producers can exist at all.
- `src/scene.rs` gained `effect_visible(valid_time, night)`; `Effect::valid_at`
  delegates to it so the loaded state and the published state cannot diverge.

### 1.3 Native evidence used

| Behaviour | Address | Where implemented |
|---|---|---|
| `LoadEffect` reads the 60-byte record (position/direction/up, scale/speed, valid-time, alpha, attenuation) | `0x5b33f3..0x5b34b0` | `scene::Effect::read` (pre-existing) + `install_scene_effects` |
| Normalized placement matrix, authored scale, play speed, parent install | `0x788960`, `0x5b3700..0x5b37b9` | `gfx_owner::placement_transform`, `Request.speed` |
| Day/night validity, strict `0.5` boundary, unordered counts as day | `0x5b18a1..0x5b18d4` | `scene::effect_visible` |
| Tick owners, check time eligibility, load one root per frame, return after load | `0x5b1a00…` | `Manager::update` / `Manager::load_one` |
| Keypoint clock advances before the visibility/priority gate | `0x70ba00` | `tick_owner` |
| Duplicate publication updates params in place, keeps first insertion order | `0x70bd20` | `LightPublications::publish` (pre-existing) |
| Destruction removes a pending publication | `0x70b130` | `Manager::remove` / `clear` / failed-owner path |
| Publication membership is cleared after dynamic-cell build | `0x425bf8..0x425c2c` | `consume_into` (pre-existing) |
| Specular selector enabled by ordinary ECM load | `0x6cfa64 → 0x7924b0/0x7924c1` | `world_models_gpu` assignment |

### 1.4 Tests added (executed in CI)

`src/gfx_owner.rs` — nine regressions:
`placement_transform_normalizes_basis_and_applies_authored_scale`,
`owner_publishes_only_between_start_and_death_then_unregisters`,
`hidden_owner_keeps_progressing_and_priority_only_gates_publication`,
`one_root_is_loaded_per_update_and_insertion_order_is_preserved`,
`duplicate_identity_and_invalid_requests_are_rejected`,
`missing_root_fails_explicitly_without_blocking_later_owners`,
`binary_roots_are_refused_rather_than_parsed_as_lights`,
`removal_and_region_unload_cannot_leave_stale_publications`,
`publication_identities_are_unique_per_owner_and_element`,
`owner_speed_scales_the_clock_and_overflow_is_explicit`.

Production GPU regression (`model-draw-gpu-check`, executed): drives
`ECWLD effect record → owner → one-root-per-update load → publication → scene
query → weighted+rigid receiving pixels`, and asserts that a region change
(`set_view_center` far away) removes the light again. Expected pixels are the
same ones the pre-existing direct-emitter fixture produced for identical light
parameters (`Range 2`, white, `Position 0,0,0.5`), so the new expectation is not
an invented baseline.

### 1.5 Task 1 gaps (precise, not approximated)

1. **Skeleton hook attachments.** ECM events with a non-empty `HookName` are
   refused with a named failure. Resolving them needs the 1.4.2 hook/joint
   binding for `SMD` hangers, which is not established by any evidence here.
2. **Visual effect playback.** The rest of the GFX graph (particles, sprites,
   trails, animated textures) is untouched; only light elements are executed.
   The effect record's authored `alpha`/`attenuation` visual fade is retained but
   not applied to the light path (it is a visual property).
3. **Manager priority source.** The native manager priority for scene-effect
   lights is not recovered, so production passes `i32::MAX` (no suppression)
   rather than inventing a threshold. The gate itself is implemented and tested.
4. **`valid_time` per-owner fade/stop.** `0x5b1a00` also fades/stops/releases
   roots; only the strict day/night eligibility is reproduced.

## 2. Task 2 — receiving classes and material rules

### 2.1 The matrix (implemented as data in `src/model_receiver_class.rs`)

| Object class | Eligibility | Material / render state | Lighting variant | Uploaded constants | Attenuation / range | Passes | Explicit exclusion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ordinary model, weighted skin mesh | visible (`transparency < 1`), no point candidate, specular selector off | `MODULATE`, alpha test per caller | `rigid_mesh_ns` (`NonSpecular`) | c7 = matamb·envamb + emissive + extra; c8 copied; c11/c12 zero | not evaluated | main, reflection, clipped refraction | — |
| Ordinary model, weighted skin mesh | as above, point candidate present | same | `rigid_mesh_ns_dl` (`NonSpecularPoint`) | c7; c8 all channels × Lambert; c11.rgb, c11.a = 0; c12 | `1/(a0+a1·d+a2·d²)`, **no range cut** | same | unsupported ECM colour override |
| Ordinary model, rigid mesh | visible, no point candidate, specular selector on | `MODULATE` | `rigid_mesh_s` (`Specular`) | c7; c8.a preserved; c9 = matspec·dirspec | not evaluated | same | morph-specular shader (different instructions) |
| Ordinary model, rigid mesh | as above, point candidate present | same | `rigid_mesh_s_dl` (`SpecularPoint`) | c7; c8.a preserved; c9; c11.a = 0; c12 | denominator floored to ≥ 1 before reciprocal | same | alpha mesh without a supported blend mapping |
| Baked BMD scenery | never | baked `MODULATE2X` | — | baked day/night vertex bytes (`0x7b9bc0`) | n/a | main, reflection, clipped refraction | already baked: runtime point light would double-light it |
| Terrain | never | layer/mask/lightmap | — | T2LM tile colours | n/a | main, clipped water | already lightmapped |
| Grass | never | instanced, area lightmap | — | T2LM area colours | n/a | main, clipped water | already lightmapped |
| Tree/foliage | never | approved fallback shader | — | preserved | n/a | main, reflection | approved lighting must not change |

Implemented API: `Recipient::{receives_runtime_scene_lights, light_source,
passes}`, `MeshKind`, `Variant::{shader, point_enabled, attenuation_floor_one,
alpha_uses_directional_lambert}`, `assign(kind, specular_selector,
point_enabled) -> Result<Assignment>`, `attenuation_denominator`, and `MATRIX`
(the table above as data, so a missing class/variant fails a test).

Production consumer: `world_models_gpu::update_pass` now derives
`frame.specular_variant` and `lighting.point_enabled` from
`model_receiver_class::assign(Weighted, true, point.is_some())` instead of a
hard-coded flag, i.e. the matrix drives the submission.

### 2.2 Queue, blend and alpha state (`src/model_queue.rs`)

- `Factor` (D3D8 `D3DBLEND` 1–10) + `blend_factor(code)`; **11 `SRCALPHASAT` and
  12 `BOTHINVSRCALPHA` are explicit errors** — no invented equivalent.
- `MeshQueueState { queue, source, destination, depth_write }` and
  `mesh_state(...)`, which classifies with the existing 1.4.2 rule and resolves
  the authored blend factors in one place.
- `AlphaCandidate` + `alpha_order()` replay the retail insertion walk
  (`0x7a5a1d`) in source order, including the 1.4.2 same-model AABB rule and the
  group-weight rule.
- `model_draw::prepare` no longer rejects every non-default blend pair (that
  made the alpha queue unreachable); it now rejects only pair codes with no
  pipeline equivalent, plus a non-opaque ECM colour override.

### 2.3 Tests added (executed in CI)

- `model_receiver_class`: `only_ordinary_models_receive_runtime_scene_lights`,
  `every_variant_is_distinguishable_by_its_own_flags`,
  `morph_and_supple_receivers_are_rejected_not_approximated`,
  `attenuation_has_no_range_cutoff_and_floors_only_for_specular`.
- `model_queue`: `authored_blend_codes_map_to_d3d8_factors`,
  `mesh_state_writes_depth_only_for_the_opaque_queue`,
  `alpha_order_replays_the_insertion_walk_far_to_near`,
  `alpha_order_keeps_group_and_same_model_rules`.
- The module is now part of `tools/check-phase1-core.sh` (dependency-free).

### 2.4 Task 2 gaps

1. **Mesh-level transparency is not parsed.** The current `SKI` reader has no
   per-mesh transparency field, so `Lighting.transparency` is the frame value the
   caller supplies. The strict-positive override (`c8.a = 1 − transparency`) is
   implemented and tested, but its *source* is not established for 1.4.2.
2. **Morph/supple receiving classes** remain explicit errors (no such records in
   the census; the shaders differ and are not reproduced).
3. **Fixed-function alternatives** for the model path were not established by
   the inspected client in this session; nothing substitutes for them.
4. **Alpha-list priority weights/groups** are zero, so ordering reduces to the
   recovered distance rule.

## 3. Task 3 — production model submission

### 3.1 What changed

- `src/model_receiver_gpu.rs`: `Receiver::new_blended(...)` takes the authored
  D3D8 pair; `new`/`new_opaque` keep their exact previous behaviour.
- `src/model_draw_gpu.rs`: `Draw` now owns an opaque receiver and, when any mesh
  classifies alpha, an alpha receiver built from the authored factors with
  z-write disabled. Meshes are `Vec<Option<Mesh>>` so a `Hidden` mesh is never
  submitted. Each mesh stores its **initial (bind-pose) AABB** — the retail sort
  uses the eight transformed *initial*-box corners — plus an `alpha_meshes()`
  list and `mesh_bounds(index)`.
  `draw_opaque` / `draw_alpha_mesh` allow the world to submit the alpha list in
  retail insertion order across models; `draw()` keeps the old whole-model order
  for direct-draw regressions.
- `src/world_models_gpu.rs`: `World::draw` emits all opaque meshes first, then
  the retail alpha order (`alpha_order()`); the order is rebuilt only in the
  advancing (main) pass, so reflection/refraction reuse the same snapshot.
- `src/gpu.rs`: unchanged pass structure; the secondary passes still pass
  `advance == false`, so they neither tick playback nor consume publications.
  `camera.logic_delta_ms` (the already capped root tick) remains the only
  interactive clock; `Playback`'s diagnostic/initial-random-phase inputs are not
  capped.

### 3.2 Tests added (executed in CI)

`model-draw-gpu-check` additions:
- authored non-default blend pair → both meshes land in `alpha_meshes()`, the
  alpha pipeline builds, bounds are available;
- an unsupported pair (`11`) fails `Draw::new` instead of being coerced;
- the ordinary opaque ECM puts nothing in the alpha list;
- the scene-effect owner end-to-end pixel case (section 1.4).

### 3.3 Task 3 gaps

1. **Alpha z-write state.** The retail state for the alpha list was not
   recovered; `model_queue::ALPHA_DEPTH_WRITE = false` is a named, documented
   assumption (register entry), not a silent default.
2. **Per-mesh transparency** (section 2.4.1) also limits which meshes can reach
   the alpha queue from authored data.
3. **Model material variants** beyond the four ordinary variants (morph,
   untextured, unsupported texture stages) remain explicit errors.

## 4. Explicit exclusions preserved

`Recipient::BakedModel`, `Terrain`, `Grass` and `Tree` all return
`receives_runtime_scene_lights() == false`, are listed in `MATRIX` with their
light source, and are asserted by `only_ordinary_models_receive_runtime_scene_lights`.
No baked BMD, terrain, grass or tree vertex path was modified, and no scene light
reaches those paths. Approved tree geometry/motion/lighting is untouched.

## 5. Controller-108 LUT construction precision and load-thread context

The verified render-thread sampling (`0x6ec190..0x6ec22e`, PC24 per instruction)
is *not* evidence for how the 128-entry table is built on the loading thread.
The table construction is now an explicit, named choice instead of an accident of
the surrounding arithmetic:

- `gfx_color_track::Precision { Extended, Pc24 }`, `CONSTRUCTION = Extended`,
  `ColorTrack::new_with_precision`, `construction_divergences()`.
- Evidence that the choice is material, reproduced by
  `python3 tools/analyze-color-track-construction.py` (12 s, pure stdlib). It
  mirrors `channel()`/`build()` exactly: the stored reciprocal is
  `0x3c010204 = 2113665/2^28`, every operation is rounded to IEEE-754 single
  precision, and every result is truncated to an integer byte exactly like the
  native store. Over all 65,536 `(from, to)` byte pairs and all 126 interior
  indices:

| Interpolation order | Interior entries differing from the integer table |
|---|---:|
| `a·(1−f) + b·f`, every operation rounded to f32 | **17,790 / 8,257,536** |
| `a + (b−a)·f`, every operation rounded to f32 | **16,332 / 8,257,536** |

  Worst endpoint pair: `from = 63, to = 190`, where **all 126** interior entries
  differ. So neither float order is "close enough" to dismiss.

- Concrete case used as a regression: `from = 0, to = 127, i = 1` gives `0` in
  the integer table and `1` in both float orders (because the stored reciprocal
  is slightly below `1/127`, while `f32(127 × reciprocal)` rounds up to exactly
  `1.0`). Authored endpoints (`i = 0`, `i = 127`) are exact in all modes.
- `ColorTrack::construction_divergences()` now compares the two *built packed
  tables* per interior index. The first version of this counter passed packed
  colours into the per-byte interpolation helper, which the CI run caught as a
  wrong count (125 vs the correct 118 for one endpoint pair); the regression now
  recomputes the expected count from `build()` instead of hard-coding a
  constant, and asserts `0 < divergences <= 126`.
- `gfx-light-runtime-survey` now prints the corpus-wide divergence count, so the
  real archive yields the number rather than an assumption.

**Blocked, not guessed:** the native loading-thread FPU mode (and even the native
interpolation operand order) is not established by the supplied executable in
this environment. `Extended` is retained because it is the only mode the existing
independent oracle has validated. This is recorded as an open item in the
unsupported-path register; it is not claimed resolved.

## 6. Confirmation checks

### Task 1

- **Task:** P1.01 — complete scene-light selection and producer lifecycle
  (owner graph, parent resolution, lifetimes, region load/unload).
- **Finished — Yes/No:** **No.**
- **Production integration:** Yes. `World` owns a `gfx_owner::Manager`; the
  actual `ECWLD` effects and hook-free ECM `EventType 100` roots are installed by
  `gpu.rs` and tick/publish/consume inside `update_pass` before the receiving
  draw; region changes and owner death unregister publications.
- **Native evidence:** `0x5b33f3`, `0x5b3700`, `0x5b18a1`, `0x5b1a00`, `0x70ba00`,
  `0x70bd20`, `0x70b130`, `0x425bf8` (all previously traced; no new trace in this
  session).
- **Tests executed and results:** executed in CI, all passing.
  `cargo test --bin perfect-world-explorer` → **250 passed; 0 failed**, which
  includes the ten `gfx_owner` regressions and the `gfx_light` owner-clock
  regressions. `model-draw-gpu-check` (lavapipe) → **exit 0**, including
  "scene effect owner passed: ECWLD placement -> one-root-per-update load ->
  publication -> scene query -> receiving pixels, and region unload removes the
  light". `sh tools/check-phase1-core.sh` → **exit 0** with the new
  multi-module `gfx_owner` harness.
- **Remaining gaps:** skeleton-hook attachments (explicit failure today), visual
  GFX playback, native manager priority source, owner fade/stop/release phases,
  and unexecuted validation.

### Task 2

- **Task:** P1.02 — complete receiving-class eligibility and lighting
  calculations.
- **Finished — Yes/No:** **No.**
- **Production integration:** Yes for the four ordinary variants: the matrix
  drives `specular_variant`/`point_enabled`, the arithmetic is unchanged and
  tested, and the exclusions are asserted.
- **Native evidence:** `0x7a6eff`, `0x7a6110`, `0x7a62db..0x7a630f`, `0x7a63af`,
  `0x7a76a0`, `0x7924b0/0x7924c1`, `0x6cfa64`, `0x7a5857..0x7a58c2`,
  `0x7a5a1d..0x7a5aef`, `0x7b9bc0` (baked exclusion).
- **Tests executed and results:** executed in CI. `model_receiver_class` and
  `model_queue` compile standalone under `rustc --test` and pass there
  (4 + 14 tests), and the same tests run inside
  `cargo test --bin perfect-world-explorer` (**250 passed; 0 failed**).
  `model-receiver-gpu-check` → **exit 0** (variant arithmetic and uploaded
  constants unchanged and still matching the independent references).
- **Remaining gaps:** mesh-level transparency source, morph/supple classes,
  fixed-function alternatives, alpha-list weights/groups, unexecuted validation.

### Task 3

- **Task:** P1.03 — production integration without double-lighting baked content.
- **Finished — Yes/No:** **No.**
- **Production integration:** Yes for the ordinary queue plus the new alpha
  queue and retail alpha ordering; FX publications now reach the production
  receivers; baked BMD/terrain/grass/tree paths remain untouched.
- **Native evidence:** `0x7a5857` (queue), `0x7a76a0` (blend factors + alpha
  test), `0x7a5460` (initial-AABB corner distance), `0x7a5a1d` (insertion),
  `41a32e–41a349` / `42b479–42b4a3` (alpha compare + reference).
- **Tests executed and results:** executed in CI. `model-draw-gpu-check` →
  **exit 0** with the alpha routing case (authored pair → `alpha_meshes() ==
  [0, 1]`, opaque submission skips them, unsupported pair `11` → `Err`), the
  opaque-ECM case, and the scene-owner pixel case. The whole
  `pr-checks.yml` GPU step (13 binaries) → **success**; Windows x64 build →
  **success**. Two defects were found by these runs and fixed (section 10).
- **Remaining gaps:** alpha z-write state (documented assumption), per-mesh
  transparency, unexecuted validation, and full multi-view alpha parity.

## 8. Interface changes affecting other agents

- **To Agent 2 (regional lighting):** no change to `client_regional_light` or the
  frame constants you supply; `world_models_gpu` still consumes
  `RegionalLight::ambient/diffuse/specular/toward_sun` exactly as before. New:
  the same `World` now *also* owns runtime light producers. If you add a second
  consumer of the grid, it must consume publications exactly once per frame —
  only the main pass calls `owners.update` + `consume_into`.
- **To Agent 3 (post/gamma/fog):** the alpha queue submits blended meshes with
  authored factors into the encoded UNORM scene target, so your encoded-space
  compositing assumptions still hold; no linear-space blending was introduced.
  `ALPHA_DEPTH_WRITE` is false and needs your eventual pass-ordering input.
- **Shared `src/gpu.rs`:** the only edits are the producer installation block in
  `Renderer::new`, `set_view_center` in `draw_models`, one new `Renderer` field
  (`model_scene`), and a status line. No unrelated section was reformatted.

GPU regressions (need a working adapter; CI uses lavapipe):
`model-draw-gpu-check`, `model-receiver-gpu-check`, `model-light-gpu-check`.

Archive diagnostics (need the private client):

```sh
cargo run --locked --bin gfx-light-runtime-survey -- /path/to/element/gfx.pck
cargo run --locked --bin gfx-light-audit -- /path/to/element
cargo run --locked --bin scene-model-light-survey -- world.ecwld scenelights.dat

## 10. Defects found by the first executable run (and fixed)

Running the branch in CI was not a formality; it found three real defects that
the review pass had not:

1. **Alpha meshes were submitted through the opaque pipeline.**
   `model-draw-gpu-check` failed with a wgpu validation error
   ("Incompatible bind group at index 0 ... Assigned implicit bind group layout
   without label"): each `Receiver` builds its own implicit bind-group layout, so
   an alpha binding drawn by the opaque pipeline is invalid. `draw_opaque` now
   skips alpha-list meshes and `draw_alpha_mesh` submits them in retail order
   (`1be0c72`).
2. **`construction_divergences()` fed packed colours to a per-byte helper.**
   The viewer test asserted `4 * 126` and got `125`, exposing that the counter
   compared `0x7f7f7f7f` as if it were a single byte channel. The counter now
   compares built packed tables and the test derives its expectation from
   `build()` (`3e1a1ed`).
3. **Hand-formatting was not rustfmt-clean.** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
   failed on 7 files; CI applied rustfmt (`e5883bc`) and the branch is now
   format-clean (`0`-byte patch on the next run).

Neither defect would have been visible without executing the regressions — which
is exactly why the "no completion claims from compilation" rule matters: the
compilation itself was green on the first CI run; only execution caught these.

## 11. Final status

| Task | Implemented in the production path | Finished |
|---|---|---|
| P1.01 scene-light selection and producer lifecycle | Yes (scene effects + hook-free ECM events) | **No** |
| P1.02 receiving classes and lighting calculations | Yes for the four ordinary variants; matrix + exclusions | **No** |
| P1.03 production submission without double lighting | Yes for ordinary + alpha queues, one snapshot | **No** |

All three rows now also have executed evidence: PR #3, run `41488072928` on
commit `9b7996e` — `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo check --locked --bins` clean,
`cargo test --bin perfect-world-explorer` 250 passed / 0 failed, all 13 GPU
regressions exit 0, `tools/check-phase1-core.sh` exit 0, Windows x64 build
success. The "No" verdicts now rest on the *named remaining gaps* in sections
1.5, 2.4 and 3.3 (hook attachments, visual GFX playback, native manager priority,
owner fade/stop phase, mesh-level transparency source, morph/supple classes,
alpha z-write state) rather than on unverified code.

No central Phase 1 gate was changed to Yes, and
`Findings/Eight-phase-reassessment-2026-11-02.md` /
`Findings/Phase-1-completion-checks.md` keep their recorded decisions.

## 12. Hook attachment of model-event producers (added after §1.5 was written)

The `HookName` gap in §1.5 is now implemented, not deferred.

### 12.1 Native evidence

| Address | Recovered behaviour |
|---|---|
| `0x6f2f8c`–`0x6f3090` | ECM event record parse order: `HookOffset: %f, %f, %f` into three floats, then `HookYaw: %f`, `HookPitch: %f`, `HookRot: %f`. Field-name pointer table at `0x97cf68`/`0x97cf6c`/`0x97cf70`/`0x97cf74` resolves to `HookOffset`/`HookYaw`/`HookPitch`/`HookRot`; the following slots are `BindParent: %d`, `FadeOut: %d`. |
| `0x6e1370` | Builds the event's local transform: loads `+0x34` (`HookRot`), `+0x2c` (`HookYaw`), `+0x30` (`HookPitch`) and calls `0x7b6f10`, then `0x7b6ef0` → `0x7f5711` (quaternion → 3x3) and copies `+0x20/+0x24/+0x28` (`HookOffset`) into the matrix' last row (`+0x30` of the matrix at `event+0x3c`). Last-row translation = row-vector convention. |
| `0x7b6f10` | Quaternion from `(pitch, yaw, rot)`, each angle multiplied by the constant at `0x8eff98` = **0.5** (half angles) and **no** degree conversion (no `π/180` constant anywhere in the chain), so the record is in radians. Component order out = `(x, y, z, w)` with `w = cx·cy·cz + sx·sy·sz`. |
| `0x7b2400` | `A3DSkeletonHook::Load`: 8-byte name/index, `0x48`-byte stored record (`+0x10` bind index, `+0x14` 4x4, `+0x54` second 4x4, `+0x94` scale), `Failed to read hook data` at `0x98e3c8`. |
| `0x7b2520`/`0x7b2543`/`0x7b25a9`/`0x7b25e6` | Per-frame hook resolution: bind index `< 0` → `model · hook`; otherwise bounds-check against the skeleton's bone count and combine the posed bone with the hook (`0x7873a0`). Missing hooks are never silently placed at the origin. |
| `0x7b3130`/`0x7b3216` | `A3DSkeleton::Load` hook loop (`Failed to load hook %d` at `0x98e560`), i.e. hooks are a first-class asset feature of the loaded skeleton, not a stub. |

### 12.2 Implementation

* `src/model_attachment.rs` (new): `Attachment { hook, offset, euler }`, `from_fields`
  (absent/blank `HookName` = not attached; a malformed `HookOffset`/angle is an
  explicit error), `Attachment::local()` (half-angle quaternion, radians,
  translation column) and `world(hook_world, local) = hook_world * local`.
* `src/model_asset.rs`: `action_pose`/`bind_pose` return the evaluated pose;
  `hook_matrix(&pose, name)` (free function + method) resolves a named hook to a
  world matrix using `pose.absolute[bone] * hook` or `pose.model * hook` for a
  negative bind index, with explicit errors for unknown names, missing bones and
  non-finite records.
* `src/gfx_owner.rs`: `Request::attachment: Option<[f32;16]>` plus
  `Manager::set_attachment`, `Manager::attachment`; `tick_owner` now publishes at
  `parent * transform`, validated for non-finite parents (`multiply`/`translation`
  are local so the dependency-free core-check harness still compiles this module).
* `src/world_models_gpu.rs`: `World::update_pass` is now
  `advance_poses → resolve_attachments → apply_activation → owners.update →
  grid.update → consume_into → draw_models → rebuild_alpha_order`. Each slot
  keeps `SlotPose { pose, meshes }`, so a hook is resolved from the same pose the
  pass draws, and reflection/refraction passes reuse the pose instead of
  re-advancing playback. `install_model_events` installs hooked roots with the
  authored hook-local transform; `resolve_attachments` removes an owner whose
  parent pose failed, whose model is gone or whose hook does not exist, and the
  producer is dropped rather than retried against a stale parent.

### 12.3 Tests added (executed in CI)

`src/model_attachment.rs` — 8 tests: absent/blank hook name, identity
attachment, offset in the translation column, yaw/pitch/roll axis direction in
radians, hook-as-parent composition, malformed record errors, non-finite
composition. `src/model_asset.rs` — 3 tests: posed-bone hook, negative-bind
(model) hook, unknown hook / missing bone / non-finite matrix errors.
`src/gfx_owner.rs` — 2 tests: attachment follows the live parent in the same
frame (position moves with the parent, nothing is left at the old position,
attachment is dropped with the owner), non-finite parent fails the owner and is
recorded. All of them run in `cargo test --bin perfect-world-explorer`.

### 12.4 Remaining gaps after this change

`ChildHook`/`RelHook`/`BindParent` target selection (multi-hook chains), static
`ECMHook` hanger objects (`0x6f89c0`, `ID`/`Scale`/offset records), hook *scale*
(`+0x94`), and the effect's own fade/stop/release phase are still open and are
named in `Findings/Unsupported-client-paths.md`.
