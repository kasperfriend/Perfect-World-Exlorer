**Navigation update:** The viewer now uses all 54 main-world client targets and 88 original map tiles, with a live overhead-map option and click teleport. Client landmark/tile/height checks found no horizontal coordinate flip. Local-light research advanced, but lighting rendering was not changed; hierarchy and material behavior still need verification.

**Latest iteration:** Denser distant terrain and client-derived grass noise/history were added, with synthetic GPU regressions. Existing tree, water and lighting shaders were preserved. The remaining lighting gaps below have not been closed or measured against the running game; no percentage-point parity gain is claimed.

# Perfect World Explorer — renderer parity assessment

**Baseline: 1 November 2026. Target: the supplied Perfect World 1.4.2 client, maximum visual settings, all relevant world-rendering content, no gameplay.**

**Update — grass patch transforms and experimental wind:** Client executable analysis now informs RANMAR-based patch jitter, yaw and scale variation, and the optional GPU wind uses the reconstructed per-vertex softness weight. The wave itself is approximate and off by default. No in-game visual comparison or overall percentage gain has been established.

**Previous update — client grass distance fade:** The grass GPU pass now uses the retail vertex shader’s per-vertex squared-distance alpha, per-type sight range and alpha cutout behavior. Synthetic GPU coverage matches a CPU reference, including lightmapped grass, but grass placement, wind and image-level parity remain unverified. The World setting can restore the previous visibility.

**Update — experimental regional tree lighting:** World settings can now opt into region-authored day/night ambient and directional colors and direction. The default remains unchanged to preserve the approved tree appearance. After a user report of overexposure and oversaturation, the experiment now uses bounded illumination and a restrained regional color tint instead of applying a branch shader’s 2× operation to all foliage. This is still an approximation, not the original SpeedTree materials; real-client comparison and user visual confirmation remain outstanding, and no overall parity gain has been measured.

**Update — client day/night schedule:** The world-clock blend curve is now recovered and used for baked terrain, grass and BMD lighting and regional fog. Isolated real-asset GPU arithmetic tests pass at twelve clock times. Sky and tree shader lighting remain approximations, and no matched-client visual comparison has established a quantitative parity gain.

**Update — regional fog transitions:** The new build uses the client’s authored transition duration (5,000 ms in all 99 surveyed world boxes) and linear day/night endpoint interpolation. The prior percentages remain unchanged: no matched-client visual measurement establishes a +10-point overall gain.

## How to read the percentages

These are **engineering estimates, not measurements of pixel similarity or a verified completion metric**. The weights and scores are judgments based on the implemented code, client-file surveys, reverse engineering, synthetic GPU tests, and your reports that the current build works and trees look good. There is not yet a matched-camera, matched-time visual comparison against the running client. Consequently, confidence in all visual-parity percentages is low; the target for every row is 100%. More categories or client behavior may still be discovered.

The 15 rendering categories below have illustrative weights totaling 100%. Their weighted score is approximately **44%**, rounded to **about 45%**, with a wide uncertainty of at least ±15 percentage points. It is a planning aid, not evidence that any particular screenshot is 45% correct. A 100% claim requires the validation at the end of this document.

## Important boundaries

- **Main world only:** dungeons, instances and other maps are not established as complete. The percentages are not a promise of coverage outside the main world.
- **Scene-light parser is a foundation, not a lighting port.** The 1,993 records load and validate, but are not yet rendered; static BMDs already carry baked light and must not be blindly double-lit.
- **Tree geometry has been user-verified as visually good**, not proven 100% identical across all 59 types, LODs, times and weather.
- **Water, fog and bloom contain recovered pieces plus approximations.** A passing shader arithmetic test does not validate the complete render pipeline.
- **Building culling is experimental.** The per-mesh original override remains unresolved; disable it in World settings if intended surfaces disappear.
- Music, minimap, launcher, controls and other UI are useful Explorer features but are not included in the graphics-renderer weighted score. Music and minimap still have the limitations documented in `TODO.md`.

## Evidence supporting the estimates

1. Client files and the PE32 executable have been inspected; full game assets are not redistributed with the program.
2. Reassembled `litmodels.pck` matches the original Drive MD5. All 16,335 world BMDs, 40,579 meshes and 7,802,464 vertices decode. A real BMD's day/night colors pass an isolated GPU blend test; this is not proof of final scene appearance.
3. Actual terrain day/night lightmap pairs, shader arithmetic, some water/fog paths, grass instancing and tree LOD have isolated tests. Tests on a software Vulkan GPU establish code behavior, not equivalence to the live client.
4. You have reported that trees look good and the latest model-facing release works. This is valuable usability evidence, but not a systematic matched-scene comparison.

## Requirements to call a subsystem 100%

- Recover the corresponding client assets, execution path, parameters, materials, render states and transitions, including exceptional cases.
- Compare against captures from the actual client at matched camera position, resolution, settings, time of day, weather and scene loading; cover representative regions, near/far LODs, underwater and day/night transitions.
- Track measurable image differences and diagnose remaining mismatches; include temporal comparisons for animation.
- Run regression tests on Windows and a real GPU without breaking previously verified locations. Include failure cases, long travel, repeated settings changes and both local/whole-world modes.
- Update the scores only when evidence justifies the change. Coverage counts, successful parsing and subjective implementation estimates are not themselves visual-parity measurements.

## Next lighting work

1. Recover the complete spatial-cell scene-light query, second dynamic-light list and time-dependent scaling; identify which render classes use it.
2. Recover the real time-of-day factor and regional ambient/directional/light colors and their transitions; connect them to trees and applicable models without double-lighting baked scenery.
3. Verify BMD per-mesh state, lightmap UV mapping, D3D9 sampler/sRGB/gamma behavior and shader constants.
4. Capture matched day, night, dawn, region boundaries and local-light examples; use those references to correct fog, sky, terrain, trees and model response together.
