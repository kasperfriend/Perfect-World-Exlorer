# NPC and monster fields: where each number comes from

The Librarian's **NPCs** tab renders `elements.data` only. Every offset below was
checked twice: once by parsing the shipped file with the v27 layout, and once by
comparing the offset against the layout's own field heading, so a wrong field
name cannot hide behind a plausible-looking value.

## Layout

`PerfectWorld/cfg/PW_1.4.2_v27_2.cfg` (ipasetto/MyAceEditor) is the authority for
section names, field order and widths. Walking it as

- `int32` / `float` → 4 bytes,
- `string:n` / `wstring:n` → `n` bytes (a `wstring` is UTF-16LE),
- `byte:AUTO` → variable, only in the three sections this tab never reads,

reproduces `NPC_ESSENCE` = 852 bytes and `MONSTER_ESSENCE` = 1528 bytes, and the
whole 131-section container ends exactly on the 28,613,176-byte file length.

Both sections render their text as **GBK**, not UTF-16: `Models\NPCs\npc\男npc4\男npc4.ecm`
is stored as single-byte GBK. The `Name` and `hello_msg` fields are `wstring`
(UTF-16LE) and hold real Chinese names.

## Enumerations

Three of the integer fields are enumerations, and guessing them from the values
in the data is how a viewer ends up lying. Each label below is checked against a
client or server artefact.

**`inhabit_type`** (§39@716). Not a bitmask. The server's placement switch
(`npcgenerator.cpp`, huzeming/176source, case 0–6) and the editor's own strings
(`language_en.txt` 3100–3106 in Wrechid/sELedit-) agree:

| value | label | server move environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Ground | ground |
| 1 | Water | water |
| 2 | Air | air |
| 3 | Ground+Water | water |
| 4 | Ground+Air | ground |
| 5 | Water+Sky | air |
| 6 | Ground+Water+Air | ground |

Shipped values: 3680 × 0, 166 × 1, 359 × 2, 2 × 3, 1 × 6.

**`short_range_mode`** (§39@604). sELedit labels `""` as *Ranged* (3130) and `1`
as *Close Range* (3131); the server turns a non-zero value into the 4 m
close-range attack distance (`pImp->_cur_item.short_range = 4.0f`). Shipped
values: 734 × 0, 3474 × 1.

**`stand_mode`** (§39@724). The header comment is byte-damaged in every mirror,
but the three names survive as 站立 / 双足站立 / 悬空站立 — standing, biped
standing, hovering. Shipped values: 1249 × 0, 2212 × 1, 747 × 2.

**`after_death`** (§39@968). The header lists a no-effect case, 自爆
(self-destruct) and a third case that the record pairs with the
`after_death_summon_monster_*` fields. Shipped values: 4131 × 0, 77 × 1, and no
record uses the third.

## Units that are not what they look like

- **`tax_rate`** (§58@208) is already a *percentage*: the file holds 0.05, 3.7616,
  8, 17 and 100. Multiplying by 100 would print 376% for a black-market vendor.
- **`refresh_time`** (§58@72) is a float of seconds (60, 10, 300), not a count.
- **`id_pet_egg_captured`** (§39@552) sits immediately before `life` (§39@556);
  reading life at 552 shifts every later field by one slot and reports egg ids as
  hit points.

## What cannot be resolved from `elements.data`

Monster skill ids (`id_skill`, `skills_1..32`) and the pet-egg skill lists name
skills defined in `configs.pck`. Without the client's `skillstr.txt` the tab
prints the id and the level and does not invent a name. Levels in the shipped
data run 0–15 across 221 distinct ids.

Drop tables reference 71,733 item ids. 71,252 resolve to an item template in the
same file; the 475 references to `3365` and the 6 references to `14145` do not,
and the tab says so rather than dropping them silently.
