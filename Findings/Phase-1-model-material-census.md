# Phase 1 — actual skin/material receiver census

## Scope and results (2026-11-02)

The private client archive has **40,753 entries**, including **10,898 SKIs**:
7,247 version 8 and 3,651 version 9. Its serialized mesh counts are 13,820
skin meshes and 1,988 rigid meshes, with no morph, supple or muscle records.
This is a data-format census, **not a renderer-support claim**.

The production Rust `Skin::parse` reader was compiled into an isolated corpus
harness and run on all extracted SKIs. **10,896 parsed; two were rejected**
for NaN weights (`0xffc00000` in the three serialized weight components):

- `models/npcs/宠物/骑宠/大龙虾/大龙虾.ski`: vertex 738.
- `models/players/通用装备/飞剑/仙鹤/仙鹤.ski`: vertices 330, 638, 639.

These are bad authored weights, not evidence for removing the finite-value
guard. Rejected records remain failures. The successful records contain
13,158 materials, 13,816 skin meshes and 1,988 rigid meshes; all produced
finite material constants and zero point-diffuse alpha in the binding check.
The isolated harness used encoding_rs 0.8.35 from its upstream tag with the
installed rustc 1.88; this is not the locked application dependency build.
CI separately compiles/tests the actual application dependency graph.

The production `Scene::load` reader found **73 unique world placements**.
Following their normalized ECM → SMD → BON/SKI dependencies found **14 ECMs,
14 SMDs, 14 BONs and 14 SKIs**, with no missing dependency at these levels.
All 14 world SKIs passed the production Rust reader and material binding:
**41 skin meshes, zero rigid meshes and 23 materials**. None of the two bad
archive records above is among these world receivers. This check does not
validate all animation tracks, textures, hangers, or runtime eligibility.

The Python header walker independently found that every SKI's serialized
skin/rigid payload ends exactly at EOF. `Skin::parse` now also rejects
unrecognized trailing payload instead of silently ignoring it. A regression
covers this guard and another verifies distinct ambient/diffuse/emissive/
specular fields through the parser-to-material-binding bridge.

## Reproducible application diagnostics

```sh
cargo run --locked --bin skin-material-survey -- /path/to/element/models.pck
cargo run --locked --bin ecmodel-check -- /path/to/element
```

`skin-material-survey` parses all SKIs and checks material binding for point
on/off, reporting a failing status for any unresolved record (including the
two known bad files in this archive). `ecmodel-check` now checks the actual
world's referenced SKIs and material bindings, rather than only checking that
filenames exist. Missing dependencies and parse/binding failures produce a
nonzero exit status. Neither diagnostic draws the receivers.

## Renderer gate

**Still open:** the 73 placements are not yet drawn by a world skin renderer.
The verified parser and material constants do not replace that integration.
Baked BMD/terrain and the approved tree path remain untouched.

### World skeleton/descriptor follow-up

The production `parse_ecm`, `parse_smd` and `Skeleton::parse` readers were also
compiled into the isolated harness (glam 0.27.0, encoding_rs 0.8.35). All 14
world descriptor/skeleton chains passed: nine SMD8/BON6 chains and five
SMD5/BON5 chains. The latter contain 77 embedded bone tracks in total; the
14 BONs contain 154 bones in total. No world SMD in this census has hangers.
Subsequently resolved all 18 external STCK1 files for the nine BON6 chains:
208 joint tracks, valid owning-skeleton joint IDs, complete payload consumption,
and finite position/quaternion samples at start/mid/end (624 transform sample
times). `ecmodel-check` includes these checks and missing tracks in its
nonzero-exit gate. Native animation/descriptor tests pass; full application
build pending CI. Runtime pose/palette conventions and world drawing remain
unverified, not replaced by this data census.
