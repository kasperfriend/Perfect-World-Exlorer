# Phase 5 agent 5C — P5.07, P5.08, P5.09

Owner: Agent 5C (environment transitions, sky/weather reflection + altitude,
Phase 5 CI wiring).
Branch `arena/e498c5d9-perfect-world-exlorer`, PR #15.
Native basis: `elementclient.exe` 1.4.2, MD5 `5f02895688fa580506e869156340a664`,
PE i386 image base `0x400000`, read with `objdump -d` (the same MD5 the existing
`src/*.rs` headers cite).

Scope respected: no change to sky geometry, sun/moon geometry, region settings
authoring, weather authoring or fog internals. Everything below consumes those
systems.

## 1. Transition / reflection state table

### 1.1 Sky resource swap — object state (`A3DSkySphere`)

| Native | Meaning | Viewer field (`sky_transition::Machine`) |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x5a4`, `+0x5a8`, `+0x5ac` | current picture handles (a whole set) | `current: Triple` |
| `+0x8c8`, `+0x8cc`, `+0x8d0` | pending picture handles | `pending: Triple` |
| `+0x5ba`, `+0x6be`, `+0x7c2` | the three name blocks | `pending`/`current` pair only; names are the loader's business |
| `+0x5b4` | counter | `counter` |
| `+0x5b0` | bound | `bound` |
| `+0x5b8` | direction: `1` counts **down**, `0` counts **up** | `count_down` |
| `+0x5b9` | textures still loading | `waiting` |
| `+0x4cc`/`+0x504` vs `+0x4e8`/`+0x544` | live vs incoming 7- and 16-dword interpolation blocks | `blend()` (linear reconstruction) |
| `[config+0x100/+0x104/+0x108]` | authored **day** triple | `day: Triple` (`author()`) |
| `[config+0x10c/+0x110/+0x114]` | authored **night** triple | `night: Triple` (`author()`) |

### 1.2 Entry points, exactly as implemented

| Address | Behaviour implemented |
|---|---|
| `0x79ac30` | the **guard**: `false` while `+0x5b4 != 0` (`0x79ac3a`) or `+0x5b9 != 0` (`0x79ac48`); `true` when any current handle is null (`0x79ac9e`) or the live block differs from the caller matrix (`0x79acd6`..`0x79ad13`); `false` when the requested names already equal the current handles (`0x79ad7d`). Never installs anything. |
| `0x79aeb0` | the **swap**: same two guards (`0x79aebc`, `0x79aec7`); sets direction `1` (`0x79aeed`); writes all three pending names; `+0x5b9 = 1`; `setle`/`dec`/`and` at `0x79b0d0`..`0x79b0dd` masks a non-positive count to `0`; that value goes to both `+0x5b0` and `+0x5b4`; count `0` runs `0x79ad90` inline and commits (`0x79b0f0`..`0x79b10b`), a positive count schedules it (`0x79b11f`). Same-as-current branch copies into `+0x4cc` and sets direction `0` (`0x79afb4`); same-as-pending copies into `+0x4e8` and keeps direction `1` (`0x79b050`). |
| `0x79a040` | the **tick**: early out on `+0x5b4 == 0` (`0x79a069`) or `+0x5b9 != 0` (`0x79a06d`); direction `0` → `+= 33`, commit at `>= bound` (`0x79a0a9`); direction `1` → `-= 33`, commit only when negative (`0x79a096`); `0x79a0c6` zeroes the counter before `0x79b180`. |
| `0x79b150` | **hurry**: inert without a counter (`0x79b156`), else `counter -= delta`, clamped up to `1` (`0x79b168`). |
| `0x79b180` | **commit**: pending handles → current slots, incoming blocks over live ones, pending cleared. |

### 1.3 Driver ladder (`0x4203f4..0x420807`)

| Phase (`config+0x70`) | Byte at `0x4204db` | Action | Address |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | any | day triple, uncounted | `0x420430` |
| `1` | any | night triple, uncounted | `0x420477` |
| `0 < p < 0.8` | `0` | day triple, `count = ftol(clock/2 · p · 1.25)` | `0x42054e` |
| `p >= 0.5` | `0` | night triple, `count = ftol(clock/2 · (1-p) · 2)` | `0x420666` |
| `0.8..1` | `0` | nothing | `0x420738` |
| `< 0.5` | `0` | nothing | `0x4207aa` |
| mid | `!= 0` | uncounted night pre-swap, then the counted swap | `0x4204f5`, `0x42060d` |
| any running swap | any | nothing (`+0x5b4` guard) | `0x420404` |
| counted | — | block on `+0x5b9` in 10 ms sleeps, then `hurry(clock/2 − count)` | `0x4205c0`, `0x420600` |

`0x4b6250` returns `0x249f00` (2 400 000) or `0x1b7740` (1 800 000), switching on
a float at `+0x74`: a 40- or 30-minute game day in milliseconds. `0x892e78` is
`_ftol` (truncating), and the `cltd`/`sub`/`sar` at `0x420559`..`0x42055c` is the
integer halving.

**Viewer decision, declared not hidden:** the driver divides that day clock
straight into a counter that the tick moves by a flat 33 per call, so the units do
not line up and the resulting fade length depends on an unrecovered tick cadence.
The viewer therefore feeds its own clock value
(`sky_transition::VIEWER_CLOCK_MS`) and keeps every recovered expression intact.
This is the one substituted constant in P5.07.

### 1.4 Reflection / altitude state (P5.08)

| Requirement | Implementation | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| sky must not shift with camera altitude | `sky_gpu::sky_inverse` clears the view translation (`rotation.w_axis = Vec4::W`) before inverting; `A3DSkySphere` only compares a cached position/radius tuple (`0x79acbd`..`0x79acd4`) and never feeds a position into a ray | `sky_gpu::reflection_tests::altitude_never_reaches_the_sky` (6 altitudes × 3 clip points × vertical and horizontal moves) and the GPU diagnostic's byte-exact comparison |
| sky correct in reflections | same inverse, mirrored about the water plane (`from_scale(1,-1,1)`), and the reflected uniform receives the **same** `(hour, celestial, alpha, sets, blend)` tuple | `reflection_mirrors_entire_ray_basis`, `sky_rays_follow_horizontally_corrected_camera_and_reflections`, GPU diagnostic requires the mirrored frame to differ from the normal frame |
| one per-frame snapshot | `Renderer::begin_frame` drives and steps the machine once, then uploads to both buffers; `sky_transition::view_sets` is the documented per-view gate | `gpu.rs::frame_snapshot_tests::one_snapshot_is_computed_per_frame_and_secondary_views_reuse_it` (existing) plus `phase5-sky-transition-gpu-check` iterating all six passes and asserting the counter is unchanged |
| a secondary view never advances time | mirrors keep `logic_delta_ms = 0` / `advances_time = false`; nothing outside `begin_frame` touches `sky_transition` | as above |
| clouds/precipitation in reflected/clipped views | **gap, with a named reason.** P5.05 is not implemented and the viewer has no authored weather to load, so the shader deliberately has **no** weather lane (a cloud layer sampled from a panorama would be invented content). When it lands it needs no new code: the reflection and refraction targets call the same fragment entry point with a mirrored basis and the same snapshot. | asserted: the WGSL contains no `p.weather` |

## 3. CI evidence

Workflow: `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` (`PR checks and Windows build`).

| Run | Head | Result | Jobs |
|---|---|---|---|
| [41650307251](https://github.com/kasperfriend/Perfect-World-Exlorer/actions/runs/41650307251) | `078fe69` (final, this report) | **success** | both jobs success |
| [41649717773](https://github.com/kasperfriend/Perfect-World-Exlorer/actions/runs/41649717773) | `0d6be4f` | **success** | both jobs success |
| [41649136848](https://github.com/kasperfriend/Perfect-World-Exlorer/actions/runs/41649136848) | `a78c698` (includes this report) | **success** | both jobs success |
| [41648372049](https://github.com/kasperfriend/Perfect-World-Exlorer/actions/runs/41648372049) | `28472c8` | **success** | `Rust checks and tests (Linux)` job `125959650883` success; `Windows executable (x64)` success |
| 41644266211 | `58d1339`+fixes | failure | compile error in the new diagnostic (fixed) |
| 41643340119 | `58d1339` | failure | `SkyGpu::new` missing the new uniform lane (fixed) |
| 41642461892 | `58d1339` | failure | formatting + the same defect (fixed) |

Linux steps in the green run (all `success`): Check formatting → x87 regional
arithmetic → requirement-status audits → **Check all binary targets** → GFX light
audit → **Run viewer unit tests** → software Vulkan → **Phase 1 production shader
regressions** (now including `phase5-sky-transition-gpu-check`) → terrain
per-view GPU check.

Commands added to the workflow:

```yaml
# Linux, "Test requirement status audits"
rustc --edition=2021 --test src/sky_transition.rs -o /tmp/sky-transition-tests
/tmp/sky-transition-tests
# Linux, "Run Phase 1 production shader regressions"
cargo run --locked --bin phase5-sky-transition-gpu-check
# Windows, "Verify native gamma and glow CPU references on Windows"
#   ... module list extended with "sky_transition"
```

Local verification in this environment (crates.io is unreachable here, so the
full `cargo check`/`cargo run` happens in CI):

* `rustfmt 1.8.0 --check` clean on every `src/*.rs` and `src/bin/*.rs`.
* `rustc --edition=2021 --test src/sky_transition.rs` → **13 passed**.
* `naga` (via the npm naga bindings) parses **and validates** the production sky
  WGSL; the pre-fix form fails with the same error CI reported.
* `tools/audit-static-model-gpu-programs.py`: **8 wired, 17 excluded with reasons,
  25 diagnostics total**.
* `tools/check-eight-phase-status.py`: `consistent: true`, 26 Implemented /
  49 Partial / 1 Not implemented, no errors.

| `src/sky_transition.rs` | **new**, 831 lines: state machine (guard/swap/tick/hurry/commit), the `0x4203f4` driver, both count expressions, `Triple`/`Request`/`Refused`, 13 tests |
| `src/bin/phase5-sky-transition-gpu-check.rs` | **new**, 412 lines: compiles the production WGSL, requires the set crossfade to move ≥10 % of pixels, requires a bit-identical frame at 4000 units altitude, requires the reflected frame to differ, and asserts no pass advances the machine |
| `src/sky_gpu.rs` | `Uniform.sets`, `set_hour()` (WGSL has no closures), `i32()` casts, translation-free `sky_inverse`, `update(..., sets, reflected)`, two new tests, the weather-lane assertion |
| `src/gpu.rs` | `sky_transition` field, one `drive` + `step` per `begin_frame`, `view_sets` gate for the normal and reflected uploads, `region_light` hoisted so all consumers share one resolution |

## 5. Remaining gaps

1. **Region sky *art* cannot be re-authored.** `sky_id_day`/`sky_id_night` are
   `configs.pck` keys; the shipped copy is not the retail v2 container
   `src/pck.rs` reads, and the loader holds one group of three panoramas. A region
   change therefore moves the fade through the clock and the flag-word gate but
   cannot change which images are loaded. `Machine::author(day, night)` is the
   single place a region mapping would land.
2. **The swap-duration unit.** Recovered counts are day-clock milliseconds while
   the tick moves a flat 33; `VIEWER_CLOCK_MS` substitutes the viewer's clock.
   Recovering the tick cadence would remove the substitution.
3. **Weather in reflections (P5.08's cloud/precipitation clause).** Blocked on
   P5.05; no weather lane exists, by design rather than by omission.
4. **Sky seams across a resource swap.** The seam test covers one set; a swap
   between authored sets is not asserted against real art.
5. **No sky-art screenshot parity.** The GPU diagnostic uses synthetic gradients;
   it proves state and shader behaviour, not that the client's panorama images
   match at the seam.
