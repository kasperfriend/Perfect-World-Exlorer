# Blockers

Each entry: step, error, what was tried, workaround chosen. A blocker keeps
the viewer working with the affected provider disabled; it is never marked
done.

## B-1 — No Rust toolchain in the working environment (Phases 0–6)

- **Step:** Phase 0/1 — `cargo build --release`, `cargo test --bin perfect-world-explorer`.
- **Error:** `cargo: command not found`; no `rustup`; no `rustc`; apt is not
  usable (`Permission denied` on the package lists and the Debian mirrors are
  unreachable); the sandbox's outbound hosts are limited to github.com,
  codeload.github.com, api.github.com, registry.npmjs.org, pypi.org and
  files.pythonhosted.org — none of which serve a Rust toolchain.
- **Tried:** `find / -name cargo`, `apt-get update`, checking
  `~/.cargo`, `/usr/local/cargo`. Installed `web-tree-sitter` +
  `tree-sitter-rust` from the npm registry to get a real Rust *parser*
  (`tools/check-rust-syntax.js`), which catches syntax regressions in the
  files edited here; it is not a type checker and does not replace `cargo
  check`.
- **Workaround:** code is written against the existing source with surgical
  edits; every touched `.rs` file is run through the tree-sitter syntax
  check. Compile/test verification is deferred to the PR's CI (Linux job:
  rustfmt, `cargo check --bins`, unit tests; Windows job:
  `cargo build --release`; both jobs also run GPU-check/audit steps that ran
  green). Local `cargo` results in the report are **not verified**.
- **CI result (2026-11-14):** run 43616119506 on HEAD `a75149f` — Linux pass
  (2m45s), Windows pass (4m34s). CI surfaced and this branch fixed:
  E0505 (`SdkReport` moved `dir` while the probe closure still borrowed it —
  `src/upscaling.rs`), E0599 (missing `Upscaler` trait import in
  `dx12-upscale-check.rs`), one stale test expectation for the shortened
  XeSS-FG reason string, rustfmt deltas across five files, and a mistake of
  mine while applying the rustfmt diff by hand (an add-only hunk was inserted
  at offset 0 of `src/main.rs`, breaking the crate attribute line — repaired
  in `a75149f` after CI caught it).
- **Status:** open locally (no toolchain here), closed on CI for HEAD.

## B-2 — No GPU (Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

- **Step:** Phase 1 GPU checks (`water-pass-gpu-check`, `simple-water-gpu-check`,
  `post-gpu-check`, `display-gamma-gpu-check`, …), and any runtime verification
  of an upscaler/frame-gen provider.
- **Error:** neither `nvidia-smi` nor `/dev/dri` exists in this sandbox; no
  Vulkan/D3D12 adapter can be created locally.
- **Tried:** `nvidia-smi`, `ls /dev/dri` — both absent.
- **Workaround:** GPU checks are marked **not verified** locally; CI runs the
  existing suite headless on lavapipe. The `--diagnose-upscale` /
  `--diagnose-framegen` viewer flags (formerly the `dx12-*-check` bins) are
  written to succeed with no GPU (they print the support matrix and SDK
  probe report, exit 0), so their logic paths can be exercised without
  hardware.
- **Status:** open (needs a Windows RTX/AMD/Intel machine + the SDKs).

## B-3 — Vendor SDKs cannot be downloaded here (Phases 3, 4, 5)

- **Step:** Phase 3/4 — integrate NVIDIA DLSS/Streamline, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS
  SDKs; Phase 5 — redistribution terms.
- **Error:** the only reachable hosts are github.com, codeload.github.com,
  api.github.com, registry.npmjs.org, pypi.org, files.pythonhosted.org. AMD's
  FSR SDK is on a reachable host (github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK)
  and its signed DX12 binaries were vendored into `sdk/` at the user's request
  (2026-11-14): `amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll`, `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll`,
  `amd_fidelityfx_framegeneration_dx12.dll` (FSR SDK v2.4.0). NVIDIA's DLSS SDK
  is not published on a reachable host and is not available at all.
- **Tried:** reachability is defined by the sandbox proxy; no fetch to vendor
  hosts was attempted beyond the allowlist (they are unreachable).
- **Workaround:** **no proprietary SDK binaries are committed**. The only
  binaries in the repository are the AMD FSR SDK 2.4.0 signed DX12 DLLs
  (MIT-style terms, notices reproduced in `sdk/AMD_FidelityFX-SDK-2.4.0-LICENSE.md`,
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`; SHA256 recorded there). Instead:
  - `src/main.rs` (the former `src/upscaling.rs`, merged into the viewer
    binary) implements the full option state machine, pairing table, jitter
    sequence, per-provider internal resolutions and quality modes — all
    unit-tested logic, compiled into the viewer.
  - `probe_sdk` (in the same merged module) probes a user-selected SDK directory
    (`PW_UPSCALER_SDK_DIR`, the `upscale_sdk_dir` settings key, or
    `<exe>\sdk\`) for the documented DLL names and reports what it finds;
    every provider stays disabled with a visible reason until a real SDK is
    present.
  - AMD FSR **is** now implemented (`src/fsr.rs`, Windows + DX12 only) and
    wired behind the same `Upscaling = FSR` setting. The upscaler is the FFX
    **Upscaling 4.1.2** provider by default; `fsr_version=` pins the major
    (0 newest / 3 FSR 3.1.6 / 4 Upscaling 4.x). The AMD loader DLL is
    loaded with LoadLibraryW/GetProcAddress; the FFX 2.4.0 upscaler provider
    is enumerated with `ffxQueryDescGetVersions` and pinned with
    `ffxOverrideVersion`; the world projection is jittered with the FFX jitter
    sequence; motion vectors are reconstructed from reversed-Z depth by a
    fullscreen pass (camera motion only — no per-actor velocity); the FFX
    dispatch runs on its own native D3D12 command list created by the same
    device, chained to wgpu through `wgpu::Device::as_hal`
    (wgpu-hal 0.19 is now a direct dependency and exposes the raw handles);
    wgpu and FFX synchronise by queue order on the single direct queue wgpu
    creates, and every native barrier restores the state wgpu's tracker
    expects. If the loader or any call fails, the viewer logs and falls back
    to the bilinear path for the rest of the session. This FFI was written
    without a GPU to test on: the jitter sign, the motion-vector direction
    and basic operation are all runtime-unverified. DLSS and XeSS are
    **not** implemented; an active DLSS/XeSS provider renders through the
    bilinear path (no temporal accumulation is faked for those). NVIDIA/Intel
    SDKs still could not be obtained. The Graphics tab states this verbatim.
  - Licenses/attribution are recorded in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` from the
    vendor terms as published (with the requirement to re-check the license
    shipped inside the SDK you download).
- **Status:** open (needs the SDKs on a Windows machine; see README "Upscaling
and frame generation").

## B-4 — Native pass-by-pass DX12 rewrite (Phase 2)

- **Step:** Phase 2 — device/swapchain, descriptor heaps, root signatures,
  PSOs, command lists, fences, barriers, upload path, and the terrain /
  static / SpeedTree / water / post / UI passes as native D3D12.
- **Error:** the change touches ~20 GPU modules and ~90 diagnostic binaries
  and cannot be compiled or tested here (B-1, B-2). A rewrite that "mostly
  looks right" but does not compile would break `main` for every user and is
  worse than the current `wgpu` path, which already runs on the D3D12 API on
  Windows through wgpu-hal (naga → HLSL → DXIL/DXBC).
- **Tried:** evaluated a from-scratch `d3d12`/`windows-rs` port — rejected:
  the crates are unreachable (crates.io is not an allowed host), so even the
  *binding* layer cannot be added to `Cargo.toml`.
- **Workaround:** §6 of `docs/dx12-port-notes.md` — DX12 is made the explicit
  default backend on Windows through wgpu; the native port is specified in
  §7 of that document but deliberately not attempted.
- **Status:** open (blocked on toolchain + GPU + Windows; crates.io
  unreachable).

## B-5 — Motion vectors / jitter / depth-in-SDK-format (Phase 3.14)

- **Step:** Phase 3.14 — enable jitter in the projection matrix, output motion
  vectors for all moving geometry (incl. Walker and Populator actors), write
  depth in the SDK-required format.
- **Error:** requires touching the shared projection used by every pass and
  every vertex shader, plus per-pass velocity outputs (skinning path included)
  and depth-format changes. Cannot be compiled or visually verified (B-1, B-2),
  and any mistake is a full render breakage, not a partial failure.
- **Tried:** scoped the change to: a unit-tested jitter sequence + matrix
  helper (`jitter_*`, now in `src/main.rs`) and a documented target/format
  requirement in `docs/dx12-port-notes.md` §7. The generic projection and
  shaders are **not** modified for other paths. The FSR path (`src/fsr.rs`,
  Windows + DX12) jitters only the world projection (UI/minimap/compositor
  stay unjittered), reconstructs camera-only motion vectors from depth, and
  feeds the SDK a raw R32_FLOAT copy of the reversed-Z depth buffer.
- **Workaround:** the FFX upscaler (Upscaling 4.1.2) consumes camera-motion MVs; actors that move in
  world space are reprojected as if static (ghosting on animated geometry is
  expected). There is still no per-object or skeletal velocity pass. DLSS/XeSS
  paths render bilinearly as before.
- **Status:** open (per-actor velocity pass + a verified FSR run on a real
  Windows GPU).

## B-6 — Open PR overlap (Phase 0.3)

- **Step:** Phase 0.3 — read the open PRs and avoid duplicating them. **Both
  were read on 2026-11-14** (files and diff, not just titles).
- **Finding:**
  - **#37** "Graphics: FSR1 upscaling and full vendor option lists (SDKs
    pending)" adds `src/upscaling.rs`, `src/render_scale.rs` changes, an FSR1
    EASU/RCAS WGSL pass, Graphics-tab lists for DLSS/FSR1/FSR2/FSR3/FSR4.1/XeSS
    and an independent frame-generation list, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, a README
    section and `GRAPHICS_TECHNOLOGIES.md`.
  - **#38** "Add named world selection to Teleport List" touches
    `Findings/Unsupported-client-paths.md`, `README.md`, `src/client_detect.rs`,
    `src/environment.rs`, `src/gpu.rs`, `src/grass.rs`, `src/main.rs`,
    `src/material.rs`, `src/modules/mod.rs`, `src/modules/populator/mod.rs`,
    `src/music.rs`, `src/navigation.rs`, `src/terrain_gpu.rs`,
    `src/terrain_store.rs`, `src/tree_source.rs`, `src/view_settings.rs`,
    `src/water.rs`, `src/windows_setup.rs`, `src/world_catalog.rs` (new).
- **Impact:** my implementation also creates `src/upscaling.rs` and edits the
  same files as #37: `README.md`, `tools/package-windows.ps1`, `src/gpu.rs`,
  `src/view_settings.rs`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` — expected textual
  conflicts for two PRs building the same feature from `main`. Against
  **#38**, the overlap is four files, all verified non-algorithmic:
  `README.md` (distinct sections: #38 edits the intro/teleport text, this
  branch edits the resolution-scale bullet, license section and layout),
  `src/gpu.rs` (#38 edits the terrain-material load, adapter/window-title,
  music/ambience and Teleport-List regions; this branch edits the instance
  creation, `render_extent` and Graphics-tab line — adjacent hunks, no shared
  changed lines), `src/main.rs` (#38 adds `mod world_catalog;` and terrain
  plumbing; this branch only *moved* `mod upscaling;`), and
  `src/view_settings.rs` (this branch edits the `encode()` format-string
  line and inserts keys/tests; #38 appends `selected_world` to the same
  format-string line and adds its own test — a textual conflict on that one
  line plus the tests tail; resolution = keep both, order irrelevant).
  `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` is **not** touched by this branch.
  This branch deliberately does **not** contain #37's FSR1 EASU/RCAS pass
  and does not pretend its vendor SDKs either — this is the SDK-integration
  follow-up to #37, not a duplicate of it. Nothing from #38 or #37 was
  copied into this branch.
- **Status:** open (PRs must be rebased/merged in order by the maintainer).

## B-7 — Frame pacing / UI input rate (Phase 4.21)

- **Step:** Phase 4.21 — with FG on, present frames in order and never drop
  the UI input rate; test with the diagnostics frame counter.
- **Error:** requires a working frame-generation provider and present loop
  (B-3) plus a Windows GPU (B-2). The FFX frame generation swapchain
  present loop is now implemented in `src/fsr/fg.rs` (proxy
  `IDXGISwapChain4` on the hwnd, UI composition texture,
  frame pacing inside `Present(1, 0)`); it has not run on hardware, so the
  pacing behaviour and the input-rate contract are unverified.
- **Tried:** diagnostics `TimingFrame`/`EffectFrames` channels exist
  (`src/diagnostics.rs`) and are the right probe; the pacing contract is
  documented for the implementer in `README.md` and
  `docs/dx12-port-notes.md` §7. The `--diagnose-framegen` viewer flag prints
  the pacing expectations it would enforce.
- **Status:** open (blocked by B-2/B-3/B-4).

## B-8 — Visual parity against the shipped client (Phases 1.7, 6.32)

- **Step:** Phase 1.7 — capture reference frames at fixed camera positions for
  terrain, SpeedTree, water, sky, Walker and Populator actors; Phase 6.32 —
  compare against the port.
- **Error:** no game client is available in the environment (and none may be
  committed), and there is no GPU (B-2). Reference frames therefore cannot be
  captured or compared.
- **Workaround:** parity is **not measured**. The unchanged rendering path is
  preserved by construction (every pixel pipeline in the world/UI chain is
  byte-identical when `Upscaling = Off`; only the Windows backend *selection*
  changes), but no frame-level evidence exists.
- **Status:** open (needs client + Windows GPU).
